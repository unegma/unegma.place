As well as the stunning interiors, it was hands down the best equipped airbnb we‚Äôve ever stayed in. Amazing books and games for children which is such a bonus. Everything was perfect, and Dave was an extremely helpful and friendly host. We didn‚Äôt want to leave, and would love to come again."

The hot tub was a welcomed extra too and plenty of time was spent in there on the chilly evenings! It‚Äôs very easy to find and is just a 30 second walk from the beach front! Will be booking again soon. Thank you to Dave and the family for an incredible stay."

The house was so clean and had such amazing attention to detail, everything had been thought about so carefully. We had such a relaxing weekend of sea swimming, walking, cooking delicious food and relaxing in the hot tub. Dave was super friendly and helpful. He let us check in early and out late. We would love to come back."

All the usual amenities were top tier but it was the added smaller touches that meant we actually didn‚Äôt leave the house as much as we had initially planned! A perfect bolt hole for those looking to escape a busy city life, enjoy walks on the beach (a 30 second walk away), relax in the hot tub, cook yummy food in the kitchen where no utensil was missing or play one of the many games provided - there is no part of you left wanting! Definitely a booking you won‚Äôt regret!"
