Unegma is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy sets out how we collect and process personal information about you when you visit any of our hosted sites, when you use our products and services (our "Services"), or when you otherwise do business or make contact with us.

Please read this policy carefully to understand how we handle and treat your personal information.

## What information do we collect?

We may collect and process the following personal information from you:

- **Information you provide to us:** We collect personal information when you voluntarily provide us with such information in the course of using our website or Services. For example, when you register to use our Services, we will collect your name, email address and organization information. We also collect personal information from you when you subscribe to our newsletter, or respond to a survey. If you make an enquiry through our website, or contact us in any other way, we will keep a copy of your communications with us.
- **Information we collect when you do business with us:** We may process your personal information when you do business with us – for example, as a customer or prospective customer, or as a vendor, supplier, consultant or other third party. For example, we may hold your business contact information and financial account information (if any) and other communications you have with us for the purposes of maintaining our business relations with you.
- **Information we automatically collect:** We may also collect certain technical information by automatic means when you visit our websites, such as IP address, browser type and operating system, referring URLs, your use of our website, and other clickstream data. We collect this information automatically through the use of various technologies, such as cookies.
- **Personal information where we act as a data processor:** We also process personal information on behalf of our customers in the context of supporting our products and services. Where a customer subscribes to our Services for their website, game or app, they will be the ones who control what event data is collected and stored on our systems. For example, they may ask us to log basic user data (e.g. email address or username), device identifiers, IP addresses, event type, and related source code. In such cases, we are data processors acting in accordance with the instructions of our customers. You will need to refer to the privacy policies of our customers to find out more about how such information is handled by them.

## What do we use your information for?

The personal information we collect from you may be used in one of the following ways:

- To deal with your inquiries and requests

- For website and system administration and security
- For general business purposes, including to improve customer service (your information helps us to more effectively respond to your customer service requests and support needs), to help us improve the content and functionality of our Services, to better understand our users, to protect against wrongdoing, to enforce our Terms of Service, and to generally manage our business
- To process transactions and to provide Services to our customers and end-users
- For recruitment purposes, where you apply for a job with us
- To administer a contest, promotion, survey, or other site features
- To send periodic emails. The email address you provide for order processing, will only be used to send you information and updates pertaining to your order. Where it is in accordance with your marketing preferences, we will send occasional marketing emails about our products and services, which you can unsubscribe from at any time using the link provided in the message.

## How do we protect your information?

We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information. We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our Payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) will not be stored on our servers.

## Do we use cookies?

Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computers hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the sites or service providers systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.

We use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits and compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.

We will only share your information with third parties in certain circumstances:

- We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us, including cloud hosting services, off-site backups, email service providers, and customer support providers. We will only share your personal information with third parties to the extent necessary to perform these functions, in accordance with the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy and applicable laws.
