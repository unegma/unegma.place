For example, when you register to use our Services, we will collect your name, email address and organization information. We also collect personal information from you when you subscribe to our newsletter, or respond to a survey. If you make an enquiry through our website, or contact us in any other way, we will keep a copy of your communications with us.

Where a customer subscribes to our Services for their website, game or app, they will be the ones who control what event data is collected and stored on our systems. For example, they may ask us to log basic user data (e.g. email address or username), device identifiers, IP addresses, event type, and related source code. In such cases, we are data processors acting in accordance with the instructions of our customers. You will need to refer to the privacy policies of our customers to find out more about how such information is handled by them.

After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) will not be stored on our servers.
